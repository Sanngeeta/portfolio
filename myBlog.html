    <h1>During Projects My Experience</h1>
    <img class="laptop-img" src="images/index.jpeg"></img>

    <p>My name is Sangeeta and right now i am doing software engineer course in navgurukul in pune campus so i want
        share my experience of during NeoG projects.

        I had a very good experience while doing projects, because I saw many new things while doing projects, read them
        and used them as well.

        I got stuck in a lot of places while doing the projects, but I tried my best to do it on my own, wherever I got
        an error, I did it myself.


        We all do self study here in Navgurukul, the same way it happens in NeoG, it was nice but as we were given
        mentors while doing projects, it was very good because when we were doing all the projects, many people from us
        got some place. But we were getting stocked, but we were being helped by mentors, which is why we are getting a
        lot of help.



        I am very excited to join NeoG to do this course because I know I will learn a lot from it and my dream is to
        become a fullstack developer, if I get this chance then I will be able to explore a lot of things I am ready to
        work hard
